        <h1>The Enchanted Forest</h1>
        <p>In the quaint village of Aldermere, nestled near the edge of an ancient forest, lived a curious girl named Lyra. Stories of the forest's magic had surrounded her since childhood, but no one dared to venture deep into its heart. One day, Lyra discovered a <span class="highlight">golden locket</span> in her attic with an inscription: "To unlock your destiny, follow the golden path." Determined to uncover its secret, she set off into the Enchanted Forest, guided by a faint glimmer of light.</p>
        <p>After hours of walking, she stumbled upon a clearing where the golden light formed a shimmering path. At its end stood a grand oak tree, its roots wrapped around a mysterious door.</p>
        <p>Lyra hesitated, but the locket in her hand grew warm, urging her forward. With trembling fingers, she opened the door and stepped inside.</p>
        <h2>Ending 1: The Heir to the Forest (Happy Ending)</h2>
        <p>Inside the tree, Lyra finds an ancient spirit who reveals that she is the chosen guardian of the forest. The locket was left by her ancestors, and her destiny is to protect the balance of nature. With newfound powers, Lyra returns to Aldermere, ensuring peace between the village and the forest.</p>
