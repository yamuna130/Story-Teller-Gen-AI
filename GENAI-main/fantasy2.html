            <h2>Ending 1: The Heir to the Forest (Happy Ending)</h2>
            <p>Inside the tree, Lyra finds an ancient spirit who reveals that she is the chosen guardian of the forest. The locket was left by her ancestors, and her destiny is to protect the balance of nature. With newfound powers, Lyra returns to Aldermere, ensuring peace between the village and the forest.</p>

        <div class="ending">
            <h2>Ending 2: The Curse of Curiosity (Tragic Ending)</h2>
            <p>The room is a trap set by a malevolent force. The door slams shut behind Lyra, and the locket fuses to her hand, draining her life force to sustain the forest's magic. Lyra becomes one with the forest, her essence trapped forever as part of the ancient oak.</p>
        </div>
        <div class="ending">
            <h2>Ending 3: The Keeper's Choice (Twist Ending)</h2>
            <p>Lyra meets an old man inside who offers her a choice: gain immense magical power but remain bound to the forest forever, or leave and forget everything she saw. Lyra hesitates but ultimately chooses to leave, returning to her village with no memory of her adventureâ€”though she occasionally dreams of golden light.</p>
        </div>
        <div class="ending">
            <h2>Ending 4: The Eternal Journey (Open Ending)</h2>
            <p>The door leads to a magical world filled with endless wonders. Lyra steps through, her fate unknown as the door disappears behind her. She is left to explore this new realm, leaving her past behind.</p>
